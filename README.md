# datavar.ai

Your data already trains AI models. You just never see a cent of it.

Datavar is our attempt to fix that. We are building a data protocol where people contribute data on their own terms and get paid when it gets used. Every record carries a signed consent receipt, so an AI team licensing a dataset knows exactly who agreed to what, for which purpose, and until when. Nothing in it is scraped or pulled from some legal gray area.

The protocol itself is still in the works. What you're looking at is the landing page for [datavar.ai](https://datavar.ai), which explains the idea to both sides of the market: the people supplying data and the teams buying it.

## Why a protocol and not just a marketplace

A marketplace can sell you a dataset. It can't prove consent, and it can't revoke access when consent expires. We want consent, licensing terms, and payouts to live at the record level, enforced by the protocol rather than by a PDF nobody reads. That's the part we think is actually hard, and the part worth building.

## Running locally

You'll need Node 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run build` creates a production build, `npm start` serves it, and `npm run lint` runs ESLint.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript.

The App Router entry lives in `src/app`, and each landing page section (hero, stats, buyers, FAQ and so on) is its own component in `src/components`.
